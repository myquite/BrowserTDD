# TestJS

The test.js file has a basic testing function and assertion function that allows you to create tests using plain JavaScript in the browser.

## Constraints

<!-- Constraints can be a good way to practice specific techniques or approaches -->

- The goal of this project is to be able to write and test functions being used in your JavaScript without installing any dependancies other than the test.js file itself.

## User Stories

<!-- Basic user story template -->

- As a developer I want to test JavaScript functions without installing depencies so that I can do Test Driven Development in the browser.
